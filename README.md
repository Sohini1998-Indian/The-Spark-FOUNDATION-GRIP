This is an internship based project which helps to get various insights regarding supervised learning.
As per the given dataset regarding 'task #2', I have gone through explanatory data analysis,visulizations,model fitting and at the end of all choosing the best fit model which can provide me the closest result as per the  specified level of model accuracy.Based on this model finally I predict how much a student can score after devoting 9.25 hours using this desired model.
